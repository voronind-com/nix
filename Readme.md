# Custom system config.

This is my own custom config that I use on my GNU/Linux machines. Not meant to be used by anyone else.

# Conventions.

## File namings.

Directory names are `snake_case` so you don't have to release the Shift key 10 times per second when tabing deep for directory.

File names are `PascalCase` to differ from directories, also it works nice with things like my archives where underscore and dash separate extra file data.
